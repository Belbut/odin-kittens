A simple Ruby on Rails project that serves both as a traditional HTML web app and a JSON-based RESTful API for managing kittens.
Built as part of The Odin Project curriculum, it covers:

HTML interface for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting kittens.

JSON API endpoints for retrieving kitten data programmatically.

Practice with Rails controllers, RESTful routes, and API responses.

The project starts with exploring the Flickr API for understanding RESTful API patterns.
